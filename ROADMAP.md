# Roadmap

## TODOs

- [ ] Detect dev env and init logger with it: **tried, to test**
- [ ] Strong type in all model related deps (object serializer, etc.) (currently
  there is too much mixed string or ModelKey types)
- [ ] Delete all releases/tags to release a proper 0.1.0-alpha.1 with changelog
  auto update
- [ ] Generics should be clearly named.
- [ ] Cookbook docs (Crud basics)
- [ ] Receipts docs (client side generated ID, "first" enhancer)
- [ ] Model and relations metadata (missing, loading, etc.)
- [ ] Tests using vitest
