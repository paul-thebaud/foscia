# Contributing

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**.

We accept contributions via Pull Requests on
[GitHub](https://github.com/paul-thebaud/func-client).

Informal discussion regarding bugs, new features, and implementation of existing features takes
place in the
[GitHub issue page](https://github.com/paul-thebaud/func-client/issues).

## Pull Requests

- **Lint your code.** Make sure your code follows our coding standards by running `yarn lint` on the
  CLI.

- **Add tests!** Your patch won't be accepted if it does not have tests.

- **Document any change in behaviour.** Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant
  documentation are kept up-to-date.

- **Create feature branches.** Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.

- **One pull request per feature.** If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull
  requests.

- **Send coherent history.** Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. We
  try to follow the
  [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

**Happy coding**!
