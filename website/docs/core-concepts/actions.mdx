# Actions

:::tip What you'll learn

-   Enhancing actions
-   Running actions
-   Extending actions for builder pattern calls
-   Conditionally enhancing and running actions
-   Registering hooks on actions

:::

:::caution Before reading this guide

This guide is only about using actions. You can read more about action factories
setups here:

- [**Make your first action factory**](/docs/getting-started#action-factory)
- [**Configure your action factory**](/docs/guides/actions/action-factory-configuration)
- [**Implement custom action factory**](/docs/guides/actions/custom-action-factory)

:::

## Instantiation

As stated in the [getting started guide](/docs/getting-started#running-simple-actions),
actions are instantiated through your action factory. In this guide, we'll admit
you have a setup action factory.

## Enhancers

An action instance can receive multiple enhancements that will build an
appropriate context to run requests to your data sources.

Each enhancer can be applied using the `use` action method. Note that those
enhancers are not instantly applied to the action context, but during the action
run step (or context computation).

```javascript
action()
    // Enhance the action.
    .use(forModel(Post))
    .use(include('comments'));
```

`use` also support variadic enhancers.
Number of arguments might be limited, check the function signature for details.

```javascript
action()
    .use(
      forModel(Post),
      include('comments'),
      sortByDesc('publishedAt'),
      // etc.
    );
```

## Runners

An action instance can be run using the `run` method. The runner can execute
multiple enhancers or runners.

When an action run, it does 3 things:

-   Dequeue all enhancers since the action instantiation and builds context
-   Execute the runner and each of its internal enhancers/runners (this may
update the context)
-   Return the runner result (might be any value, including void or an error
throwing)

Internally, action running will also trigger [actions hooks](#hooks).

```javascript
action()
    .use(forModel(Post))
    .use(include('comments'))
    // Run the action.
    .run(all());
```

## Extensions

Sometimes, functional programming can be frustrating, because you must always
rewrite the same words (e.g. `use`) to keep a builder pattern styled code.

Extensions provide a set of properties or methods which will be added
to your actions' instances. As an action, extensions can avoid you writing
`use` or `run` by adding enhancers/runners methods on you action.

The first step to use one or many extensions is to update your action factory
in which you should provide an `extension` configuration option.
If you are using a custom action factory, you should check the
[custom action factory guide](/docs/guides/actions/custom-action-factory).

```javascript title="action.js"
import { forModel, include, all } from '@foscia/core';
import { makeJsonApi, hooksExtensions } from '@foscia/blueprints';

const { action, registry } = makeJsonApi({
    extensions: {
        // Spread any extensions you want to use here...
        ...hooksExtensions,
        ...forModel.extension,
        ...include.extension,
        ...all.extension,
    },
});
```

You can now use the extended enhancers and runners without calling `use` or
`run`:

```javascript
import action from './action';

await action().forModel(Post).include('tags').all();
```

Every enhancers and runners of Foscia provide a `.extension` property
which is extendable by an action instance.

You may extend your action with any enhancers or runners extensions manually.
Otherwise, you may also use **prebuild extensions packs**. Those provide
multiple extensions in one exported object allowing you to extend multiple
extensions at one time!

:::caution

Keep in mind that using extensions will avoid tree-shaking the extended
enhancers or runners functions (even when those are unused in your codebase),
because those are imported by their extensions.

:::

## Conditionals

Sometimes, you may need to conditionally apply an enhancer or run an action. As
an example, you may want to sort results differently based on the user's defined
sort's direction. This can be done easily using the `when` helper:

```javascript
import { when } from '@foscia/core';
import { sortByDesc } from '@foscia/jsonapi';

action()
    .use(forModel(Post))
    .use(when(displayLatestFirst, sortByDesc('createdAt')));
```

`when` returns a new enhancer or runner based on the given value's
_truthiness_. It will execute the first enhancer/runner only if its value is
_truthy_. You may pass the value as a factory function returning the value,
and even a promise value. You may also pass a second enhancer/runner which
will only execute if the value is _falsy_.
Each callback arguments will receive the action as their first argument
and the value as their second argument. Each callback may also be async,
as any enhancers and runners.

Here are further examples:

```javascript
import { changed, create, oneOrFail, when } from '@foscia/core';

const post = fill(new Post(), userInputData);

action()
    .use(create(post))
    .use(when(
        () => /* compute a special value */,
        (a, specialTruthyValue) => /* do something */,
        (a, specialFalsyValue) => /* do something */,
    ))
    .run(when(
        changed(post),
        oneOrFail(),
        () => post,
    ));
```

## Hooks

You may hook on multiple events which occurs on action instance using the hook
registration function:

-   `onRunning`: after context computation, before context runner execution.
-   `onSuccess`: after context runner successful execution (no error thrown).
-   `onError`: after context runner failed execution (error thrown).
-   `onFinally`: after context runner successful or failed execution.

To register a hook callback, you must use the registration enhancer on your
building action.

```javascript
import {
    onRunning,
    onSuccess,
    onError,
    onFinally,
} from '@foscia/core';

action().use(onRunning(({ context }) => /* ... */));
action().use(onSuccess(({ context, result }) => /* ... */));
action().use(onError(({ context, error }) => /* ... */));
action().use(onFinally(({ context }) => /* ... */));
```

:::info

Hooks' callbacks are async and executed in a sequential fashion (one by one,
not parallelized).

:::

You can temporally disable hook execution for a given action by using the
`withoutHooks` function.

Be aware that `withoutHooks` will always return a promise, even when
your callback is a sync function.

```javascript
import { withoutHooks } from '@foscia/core';

// Retrieve a list of User instances without action hooks running.
const users = await withoutHooks(action(), async (a) => {
    return await a.use(forModel(User)).run(all());
});
```

:::caution

Foscia may also register hooks internally when using some enhancers. Those
provide some library features
([**models hooks**](/docs/core-concepts/models#hooks), etc.). Be careful running
actions without hooks, as those hooks will also be disable.
