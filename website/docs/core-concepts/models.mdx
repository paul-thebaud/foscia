# Models

:::tip What you'll learn

-   Defining basic models with attributes and relations
-   Extending your models with custom properties
-   Registering hooks on models

:::

## Model factory

`makeModel` is the default model factory function. It defines a new model using
2 arguments and returns an ES6 class:

-   The string `type` or a [configuration object](/docs/guides/models-configuration).
-   The optional `definition` of the model: an object map containing
attributes/relations definitions and custom properties and methods.

The attributes and relations definition represents the `schema` of the model.

```javascript
import { makeModel, attr, hasMany, toDate } from 'foscia/core';

makeModel('posts', {
    /* The model definition */
    title: attr<string>(),
    description: attr<string>(),
    publishedAt: attr<Date | undefined>(toDate()),
    comments: hasMany<Comment>(),
    get published() {
        return !!this.publishedAt;
    },
});
```

### Extending a model class

`makeModel` will return a model class which can be extended by an ES6 class.

```javascript
export default class Post extends makeModel('posts') {}
```

The returned model class also provides static methods to extend the definition
already provided to `makeModel`.

```javascript
/* Initial model creation without definition */
makeModel('posts')
    .extends({
        title: attr<string>(),
        description: attr<string>(),
    })
    .extends({
        publishedAt: attr<Date | undefined>(toDate()),
        get published() {
            return !!this.publishedAt;
        },
    });
```

This can be useful when sharing common features across models: creation
timestamps, client side ID generation, etc.

If you wish to learn more about the composition capabilities of models, you
should read the
[advanced guide about models composition](/docs/guides/models-composition).

#### Note on exported value

In many Foscia guides and examples, you will see that the ES6 class
returned by `makeModel` is extended before exporting:
we use `export default class Post extends makeModel...` instead of
`export default makeModel...`.

This has two benefits:

-   When using TypeScript, it allows to only import the type of the class using
    `import type Post from './models/post'` and avoids circular
    dependencies when models have circular relationships
-   It gives you more flexibility as you can quickly add custom properties and
    methods in the future

However, both syntax are valid. Use the one you prefer! ðŸ¦„

### Using models classes

Model classes can be used like any ES6 class. It can be instantiated,
manipulated, etc. Properties will be defined on each instance from the model
definition.

```javascript
const post = new Post();
post.title = 'Hello World!';
post.publishedAt = new Date();
console.log(post.title); // "Hello World!"
console.log(post.published); // true
console.log(post.exists); // false
```

:::info

Please note that most model's interaction (fetching, updating, etc.) are done
through actions, you can
[**read the actions guide**](/docs/core-concepts/actions) to learn more
about those.

:::

**Foscia proposes you multiple utilities functions to interact with models**

    Read the models' utilities API guide
</Link>

## Definition

:::caution

You **must** not use `id`, `lid`, `type` or `exists` as key of any
attributes/relations/properties as those keys are internally used by Foscia
or may be used by dependencies (e.g. JSON:API adapter).

:::

### IDs

`id` is an ID definition factory function used to define your
model's IDs property. It takes 1 argument.

Foscia consider your IDs as `string`, `number` or `null` values by default.
Each model have `id` and `lid` properties representing record identification.
If you want to change the typing of those properties or transform values, you
can use the `id` function.

```ts
import { id, toString } from 'foscia/core';

id<string>(); // Without config.
id(toString()); // With a transformer.
```

#### Transform

IDs transform works the same as [attributes transform](#transforms).

:::caution
`id` can only be used on `id` and `lid` keyed model's properties.
There is currently no way of aliasing an ID in Foscia.
[Please fill an issue](https://github.com/paul-thebaud/foscia/issues/new/choose)
if this is something you need.
:::

### Attributes

`attr` is an attribute definition factory function used to define your
model's attributes. It takes 0 to 2 arguments, depending on what
you want to do.

Foscia consider your attributes as non-nullable values by default.
When one of your model contains nullable attributes, you can pass a type
to the factory (e.g. `attr<string | null>()`) or set a default attribute value
(e.g. `attr({ default: '' })`).

```ts
import { attr, toDate } from 'foscia/core';

attr<string>(); // Without config.
attr(toDate()); // With a transformer.
attr({ default: null, transformer: toDate() }); // With config.
attr(toDate(), { sync: 'retrieve' }); // With a transformer and config.
attr({ default: () => [] }); // With a factory default (required for objects props).
```

#### Configuration

You can customize your attribute with the following options:

| Key           | Type                               | Default     | Description                                                                  |
|---------------|------------------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `transformer` | `Transform<T>`                     | `undefined` | The transformer for the property's value when interacting with your backend. |
| `default`     | `T`                                | `undefined` | The default value for the property when initializing a model instance.       |
| `alias`       | `string`                           | `undefined` | Alias of your backend key used for (de)serializing.                          |
| `sync`        | `boolean \| 'retrieve' \| 'write'` | `true`      | Avoid retrieving/writing the property's value from/to the backend.           |

#### Transform

You can use a `transformer` to convert an attribute value when (de)serializing
from/to your data source. There are two types or transformer within Foscia:

-   `FunctionTransform`: a function called to transform the value when
    serializing or deserializing.
-   `ObjectTransform`: an object with two methods: `serialize` and
    `deserialize`.

Foscia propose you 4 transformers out of the box:
[`toDate`](/docs/reference/api/modules/core#todate),
[`toNumber`](/docs/reference/api/modules/core#tonumber),
[`toBoolean`](/docs/reference/api/modules/core#toboolean) and
[`toString`](/docs/reference/api/modules/core#tostring).

:::info

You may need other transformers in your implementation, for example when you are
using a library to manage dates (momentjs, dayjs, etc.). You may read the
[**advanced guide on transformers**](/docs/guides/custom-transformers) to
learn more about those.

:::

### Relations

`hasMany` and `hasOne` are relation definition factory function used
to define your model's relations. As suggested by their names, `hasMany`
represents a relation to a list of models and `hasOne` represents a relation to
a single model. Those take 0 to 1 argument, depending on what you want to do.

Foscia consider your relations as non-nullable values by default.
When one of your model contains nullable relations, you can pass a type
to the factory (e.g. `hasOne<User | null>()`) or set a default relation value
(e.g. `hasOne({ default: null as User | null })`).

Also consider that non-loaded relations will have a value of `undefined`.

```ts
// file: models/user.ts noEmit
import { makeModel } from 'foscia/core';
export default class User extends makeModel('users') {}

// file: models/comment.ts noEmit
import { makeModel } from 'foscia/core';
export default class Comment extends makeModel('comments') {}

// file: models/example.ts
import { hasOne, hasMany } from 'foscia/core';
import type User from './user';
import type Comment from './comment';

hasOne<User>(); // Without config.
hasOne<User>({ sync: 'retrieve' }); // With config.
hasOne<User>('users'); // With explicit type.
hasOne<User>({ type: 'users', sync: 'retrieve' }); // With explicit type and config.

hasMany<Comment>(); // Without config.
hasMany<Comment>({ sync: 'retrieve' }); // With config.
hasMany<Comment>('comments'); // With explicit type.
hasMany<Comment>({ type: 'comments', sync: 'retrieve' }); // With explicit type and config.
```

:::tip

When using TypeScript, you should define the type of the relation to get a
type safe model. We suggest you to use `import type` to avoid creating
circular dependencies when having circular model relations.

:::

#### Configuration

You can customize your relation with the following options:

| Key            | Type      | Default     | Description                                                                                               |
|----------------|-----------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `default`      | `T`       | `undefined` | The default value for the property when initializing a model instance.                                    |
| `alias`        | `string`  | `undefined` | Alias of your backend key used for (de)serializing.                                                       |
| `path`         | `string`  | `undefined` | Path used to query the relation. Defaults to the relation's key.                                          |
| `type`         | `string`  | `undefined` | The explicit type of related model. Might be used by the deserializer to know which model to instantiate. |
| `noRetrieving` | `boolean` | `false`     | Avoid retrieving the property's value (won't be deserialized from data source).                           |
| `noSending`    | `boolean` | `false`     | Avoid sending the property's value (won't be serialized from data source).                                |

### Custom properties

In addition to attributes and relations, you can implement additional
properties to your model. It's useful when you need computed values
(getters) or specific instance methods.

This can be done using the definition or an extending class:

```javascript
// Directly in the definition.
export default makeModel('users', {
    firstName: attr(),
    lastName: attr(),
    get fullName() {
        return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`
    }
});

// Inside an extending class.
export default class User extends makeModel('users', {
    firstName: attr(),
    lastName: attr(),
}) {
    get fullName() {
        return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`
    }
}
```

### Readonly properties

To mark an ID, attribute or relation as readonly, you can use the `readOnly`
function.

When using TypeScript, this will infer the instance property as a readonly
defined property.

```typescript
import { attr, hasMany, makeModel, readOnly, toDate } from 'foscia/core';

export default class User extends makeModel('users', {
  verifiedAt: readOnly(attr(toDate())),
  notifications: readOnly(hasMany<Notification>()),
}) {}

const user = new User();
// @ts-expect-error verifiedAt is readonly
user.verifiedAt = new Date();
```

## Hooks

You can hook multiple events from your model instances using the hook
registration functions:

-   `onRetrieved`: instance was deserialized from a backend response.
-   `onCreating`: action to create instance will run soon.
-   `onCreated`: action to create instance was ran successfully.
-   `onUpdating`: action to update instance will run soon.
-   `onUpdated`: action to update instance was ran successfully.
-   `onSaving`: action to save (create or update) instance will run soon (always
    ran after `onCreating` and `onUpdating`).
-   `onSaved`: action to save (create or update) instance was ran successfully
    (always ran after `onCreated` and `onUpdated`).
-   `onDestroying`: action to destroy instance will run soon.
-   `onDestroyed`: action to destroy instance was ran successfully.

To register a hook callback, you must pass a model class and a callback function
to the registration function. It will return a function that you can call to
unregister the hook. All model hooks' callbacks have the concerned model
instance as the only provided argument.

```javascript
import { onSaving } from 'foscia/core';

// After this, the hook will run on each User instance saving.
const unregisterThisHook = onSaving(User, async (user) => {
    // TODO Do something (a)sync with user instance before saving.
});

// After this, this hook will never run again.
unregisterThisHook();
```

:::info

Hooks' callbacks are async and executed in a sequential fashion (one by one,
not parallelized).

:::

You can temporally disable hook execution for a given model by using the
`withoutHooks` function.

```javascript
import { withoutHooks } from 'foscia/core';

const syncResultOfYourCallback = withoutHooks(User, () => {
    // TODO Do something sync and return it.
});

const asyncResultOfYourCallback = await withoutHooks(User, async () => {
    // TODO Do something async and return it.
});
```
