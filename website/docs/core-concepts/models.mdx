# Models

:::tip What you'll learn

-   Defining basic models with attributes and relations
-   Extending your models with custom properties
-   Registering hooks on models

:::

## Model factory

```javascript
import { makeModel, attr, hasMany, toDate } from 'foscia/core';

makeModel('posts', {
    /* The model definition */
    title: attr<string>(),
    description: attr<string>(),
    publishedAt: attr<Date | undefined>(toDate()),
    comments: hasMany<Comment>(),
    get published() {
        return !!this.publishedAt;
    },
});
```

`makeModel` is the default model factory function. It defines a new model using
2 arguments:

-   The string `type` or a configuration object.
-   The optional `definition` of the model: an object map containing
    attributes/relations definitions and custom properties and methods.

The attributes and relations definition represents the `schema` of the model.

### Extending a model class

`makeModel` will return a model class which can be extended by an ES6 class.

```javascript
export default class Post extends makeModel('posts') {}
```

The returned model class also provides static methods to extend the definition
already provided to `makeModel`.

```javascript
/* Initial model creation with(out) definition */
makeModel('posts')
    .extends({
        /* additional definition */
    })
    .extends({
        /* another additional definition */
    });
```

This can be useful when sharing common features across models: creation
timestamps, client side ID generation, etc.

If you wish to learn more about the composition capabilities of models, you
should read the
[advanced guide about models composition](/docs/guides/models-composition).

### Using models classes

Model classes can be used as any classical ES6 class. It can be instantiated,
manipulated, etc. Properties will be defined on each instance from the model
definition.

```javascript
const post = new Post();
post.title = 'Hello World!';
post.publishedAt = new Date();
console.log(post.title); // "Hello World!"
console.log(post.published); // true
console.log(post.exists); // false
```

Please note that most model's interaction (fetching, updating, etc.) are done
through actions, so you may [read the actions guide](/docs/core-concepts/actions)
to learn more about those.

**Foscia proposes you multiple utilities functions to interact with models**

## Definition

:::caution

You **must** not use `id`, `lid`, `type` or `exists` as key of any
attributes/relations/properties as those keys are internally used by Foscia
or may be used by dependencies (e.g. JSON:API adapter).

:::

### Attributes

`attr` is an attribute definition factory function to use when you wish to
define your model's attributes. It may take 0 to 2 arguments, depending on what
you want to do.

```ts
import { attr, toDate } from 'foscia/core';

attr<string>(); // Without config.
attr(toDate()); // With a transformer.
attr({ default: null, transformer: toDate() }); // With config.
attr(toDate(), { readOnly: true }); // With a transformer and config.
attr({ default: () => [] }); // With a factory default (required for objects props).
```

Note that Foscia consider your attributes as non-nullable values by default.
When one of your model contains nullable attributes, you may want to pass a type
to the factory (e.g. `attr<string | null>()`) or set a default attribute value
(e.g. `attr({ default: '' })`).

#### Configuration

You may customize your attribute with the following config:

| Key            | Type           | Defaults    | Description                                                                           |
|----------------|----------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `transformer`  | `Transform<T>` | `undefined` | The transformer for the prop's value when interacting with your backend.              |
| `default`      | `T`            | `undefined` | The default value for the prop when initializing a model instance.                    |
| `alias`        | `string`       | `undefined` | The key to (de)serialize the prop's value from/in when interacting with your backend. |
| `readOnly`     | `boolean`      | `false`     | Makes the property read-only.                                                         |
| `noRetrieving` | `boolean`      | `false`     | Avoid retrieving the property's value (won't be deserialized from data source).       |
| `noSending`    | `boolean`      | `false`     | Avoid sending the property's value (won't be serialized from data source).            |

#### Transform

You can use a transform to convert an attribute value when (de)serializing
from/to your data source. There are two types or transformer within Foscia:

-   `FunctionTransform`: a function to call to transform the value whether we
    are serializing or deserializing it.
-   `ObjectTransform`: an object with two methods: `serialize` and
    `deserialize`.

Foscia propose you 4 transformers out of the box:
[`toDate`](/docs/reference/api/modules/core#todate),
[`toNumber`](/docs/reference/api/modules/core#tonumber),
[`toBoolean`](/docs/reference/api/modules/core#toboolean) and
[`toString`](/docs/reference/api/modules/core#tostring).

:::info

You may need other transformers in your implementation, for example when you are
using a library to manage dates (momentjs, dayjs, etc.). You may read the
[**advanced guide on transformers**](/docs/guides/custom-transformers) to
learn more about those.

:::

### Relations

`hasMany` and `hasOne` are relation definition factory function to use when you
wish to define your model's relations. As suggested by their names, `hasMany`
represents a relation to a list of model and `hasOne` represents a relation to a
single model. It may take 0 to 1 argument, depending on what you want to do.

```ts
// file: models/user.ts noEmit
import { makeModel } from 'foscia/core';
export default class User extends makeModel('users') {}

// file: models/comment.ts noEmit
import { makeModel } from 'foscia/core';
export default class Comment extends makeModel('comments') {}

// file: models/example.ts
import { hasOne, hasMany } from 'foscia/core';
import type User from './user';
import type Comment from './comment';

hasOne<User>(); // Without config.
hasOne<User>({ readOnly: true }); // With config.
hasOne<User>('users'); // With explicit type.
hasOne<User>({ type: 'users' }); // With explicit type.

hasMany<Comment>(); // Without config.
hasMany<Comment>({ readOnly: true }); // With config.
hasMany<Comment>('comments'); // With explicit type.
hasMany<Comment>({ type: 'comments' }); // With explicit type.
```

Note that Foscia consider your relations as non-nullable values by default.
When one of your model contains nullable relations, you may want to pass a type
to the factory (e.g. `hasOne<User | null>()`) or set a default relation value
(e.g. `hasOne({ default: null as User | null })`).

Also consider that non-loaded relations will have a value of `undefined`.

:::tip

When using TypeScript, you should define the type of the relation to get a
type safe model. We suggest you to use `import type` to avoid creating
circular dependencies when having circular model relations.

:::

#### Configuration

You may customize your relation with the following config:

| Key            | Type      | Defaults    | Description                                                                                                |
|----------------|-----------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `default`      | `T`       | `undefined` | The default value for the prop when initializing a model instance.                                         |
| `alias`        | `string`  | `undefined` | The key to (de)serialize the prop's value from/in when interacting with your backend.                      |
| `path`         | `string`  | `undefined` | Path which is used to query the relation. Defaults to the relation's key.                                  |
| `type`         | `string`  | `undefined` | The explicit type of related model. Might be used by the deserializer to known which model to instantiate. |
| `readOnly`     | `boolean` | `false`     | Makes the property read-only.                                                                              |
| `noRetrieving` | `boolean` | `false`     | Avoid retrieving the property's value (won't be deserialized from data source).                            |
| `noSending`    | `boolean` | `false`     | Avoid sending the property's value (won't be serialized from data source).                                 |

### Custom properties

In addition to attributes and relations, you may want to implement additional
properties to your model. It will be useful when you need computed values
(getters) or specific instance methods.

This can be done using the definition or an extending class:

```javascript
// Directly in the definition.
export default makeModel('users', {
    firstName: attr(),
    lastName: attr(),
    get fullName() {
        return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`
    }
});

// Inside an extending class.
export default class User extends makeModel('users', {
    firstName: attr(),
    lastName: attr(),
}) {
    get fullName() {
        return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`
    }
}
```

## Hooks

You may hook on multiple events which occurs on model instance using the hook
registration functions:

-   `onRetrieved`: instance was deserialized from a backend response.
-   `onCreating`: action to create instance will run soon.
-   `onCreated`: action to create instance was ran successfully.
-   `onUpdating`: action to update instance will run soon.
-   `onUpdated`: action to update instance was ran successfully.
-   `onSaving`: action to save (create or update) instance will run soon (always
    ran after `onCreating` and `onUpdating`).
-   `onSaved`: action to save (create or update) instance was ran successfully
    (always ran after `onCreated` and `onUpdated`).
-   `onDestroying`: action to destroy instance will run soon.
-   `onDestroyed`: action to destroy instance was ran successfully.

To register a hook callback, you must pass a model class and a callback function
to the registration function. It will return a function which you may call to
unregister the hook. All model hook callback will have the concerned model
instance as the only provided argument.

```javascript
import { onSaving } from 'foscia/core';

// After this, the hook will run on each User instance saving.
const unregisterThisHook = onSaving(User, async (user) => {
    // TODO Do something (a)sync with user instance before saving.
});

// After this, this hook will never run again.
unregisterThisHook();
```

:::info

Hooks callback may be async and will be ran sequentially (one by one, not
parallelized).

:::

You can disable hook execution on a given model by using the `withoutHooks`
function.

```javascript
import { withoutHooks } from 'foscia/core';

const syncResultOfYourCallback = withoutHooks(User, () => {
    // TODO Do something sync and return it.
});

const asyncResultOfYourCallback = await withoutHooks(User, async () => {
    // TODO Do something async and return it.
});
```
