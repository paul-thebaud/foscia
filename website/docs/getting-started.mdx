# Getting started

:::tip What you'll learn
- Creating your first model and using it through model instances
- Creating your action factory using blueprints for a JSON:API backend
- Running basic actions on your models with your action factory
:::

## Your first model

Models represent the structure of your data and are used to simplify and
strongly type your backend interactions.

### Defining a model

To declare a model, you just need to use the `makeModel` function. This function takes 3 arguments:

- The model `type`, which is used by other services to identify your model or interact with an API.
- The model `schema` (optional), which contains your attributes and relations definitions.
- The model `extension` (optional), which contains additional properties and methods.

```ts title="models/post.ts"
// file: models/comment.ts noEmit
import { makeModel } from 'func-client/core';
export default class Comment extends makeModel('comments') {}

// file: models/post.ts
import { makeModel, attr, hasMany, toDate } from 'func-client/core';
import type Comment from './comment';

export default class Post extends makeModel('posts', {
  title: attr<string>(),
  description: attr<string>(),
  publishedAt: attr(toDate()),
  comments: hasMany<Comment>(),
}, {
  get isDraft() {
    return !this.publishedAt;
  },
}) {
}
```

:::tip
If you never need to import only a model's type (such as in Typescript to avoid circular deps),
you can just export the `makeModel` returned value instead of creating an extended class:

```javascript
export default makeModel('posts', /* your model definition... */);
```

[Read the FAQ to understand the why.](/docs/faq#why-classes-are-used-for-models-in-typescript)
:::

### Using models

You can use this model as any Javascript classes (e.g. construct a new instance using `new`). Once
you have an instance, you can use its schema and extensions as classic classes' properties and
methods.

```javascript
const post = new Post();
post.title = 'Hello World!';
console.log(post.title); // "Hello World!"
console.log(post.isDraft); // true
```

## Your first actions

### Action factory with blueprints

Once your models are set up, you will probably want to interact with a data store, such as an API.
For this, you will need an action factory which initialize a preconfigured context
for all your future action. Running actions using this action factory will be seen in the next part
of this guide.

Blueprints provide a quick initialization of your action factory.

With the complete JSON:API action factory blueprint (named `makeJsonApi`), you can
set up your action factory for a JSON:API by providing a root URL and the models it
interacts with.

```javascript title="action.js"
import { makeJsonApi } from 'func-client/blueprints';

const { makeAction, store } = makeJsonApi({
  baseURL: 'https://example.com/api/v1',
});

// We need to register the models to allow the deserializer to know
// to which model it should deserialize a JSON:API record.
store.register([Comment, Post, /* User, Tag */]);

export default function action() {
  return makeAction();
}
```

In this example, `makeJsonApi` will initialize all dependencies to read/write on a JSON:API.
It must only be called once, because instances may be cached after a read for example.
`makeAction` is a default preconfigured action factory. It should be called on each new action
you are making, and not only once, because context enhancers are modifying the action context.

:::caution
Using blueprints is a simple and quick way to set up an action factory. However, it has some downsides:

- **Only a JSON:API implementation of actions dependencies is available for now;**
- You may not be able to configure all the behaviors you want;
- You may increase your bundle size by importing useless actions dependencies;

If you want more control over your action factory and dependencies, you should
read [the advanced guide on actions dependencies and factories (TODO)](#todo).
:::

### Running actions

To run an action, you can initialize a new action instance by calling your factory.
With this instance, you can call **context enhancers** through `use` to modify
the action context.
When you are ready, you can `run` the action with a given **context runner**.

```javascript
import { all, model } from 'func-client/core';
import Post from './models/post';
import action from './action';

const posts = await action()
  .use(model(Post))
  .run(all());
```

Generally in FuncClient, the context enhancers are doing the majority of work to
customize the action you will run. Context runners only exists to tell how
you wish to run the action and retrieve the result (raw response,
model instance, etc.).

A great example of this is when finding a model using its ID. You'll not use
a `find` context runner. Instead, you will need to use a `find` context
enhancer and a `oneOrFail` context runner. This way, you are able to do
a find query and retrieve a raw result when needed.

```javascript
import { find, oneOrFail } from 'func-client/core';
import Post from './models/post';
import action from './action';

const post = await action()
  .use(find(Post, 'abc-123'))
  .run(oneOrFail());
```

This works the same to send write operations through actions. In the following
example, we are retrieving a raw adapter response instead of model instances.

```javascript
import { create, one, fill } from 'func-client/core';
import Post from './models/post';
import action from './action';

const post = fill(new Post(), {
  title: 'Hello World!',
  description: 'Your first post',
});

const response = await action()
  .use(create(post))
  .run(one());
```

Finally, you may also want to use FuncClient to make non-standard API calls
which are unrelated to models.

```javascript
import { instance, knownData } from 'func-client/core';
import { makePost } from 'func-client/json-api';
import action from './action';

const post = await action()
  .use(find(Post, 'abc-123'))
  .run(oneOrFail());

// Make a POST call to "https://example.com/api/v1/services/posts/1/publish"
// Admitting it returns: {"message":"Successfully published post."}
const data = await action()
  .use(instance(post))
  .use(makePost('publish'))
  .run(knownData());

console.log(data.message); // "Successfully published post."
```

:::info
`data` runner will return the adapter response data (for JSON:API, it is a JSON:API document).

`knownData` will the same data but with a generic type (which defaults to any). This can be useful
when creating non-standard JSON:API services.
