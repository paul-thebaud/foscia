# Getting started

## Your first model

To declare a model, you just need to use the `makeModel` function. This function takes 3 arguments:

- The model `type`, which is used by other services to identify your model or interact with an API.
- The model `schema` (optional), which contains your attributes and relations definitions.
- The model `extension` (optional), which contains additional properties and methods.

```ts title="models/user.js"
import { makeModel, attr } from 'func-model/core';

export default class User extends makeModel('users', {
  firstName: attr<string>(),
  lastName: attr<string>(),
}, {
  get fullName() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  },
}) {
}
```

:::tip
When using Javascript, you can just export the `makeModel` returned value instead of creating an
extended class.

```javascript
export default makeModel('users', /* your model definition... */);
```

[Read the FAQ to understand the why.](/docs/discover#why-classes-are-used-for-models-in-typescript)
:::

You can use this model as any Javascript classes (e.g. construct a new instance using `new`). Once
you have an instance, you can use its schema and extensions as classic classes' properties and
methods.

```typescript
const user = new User();
user.firstName = 'John';
user.lastName = 'Doe';
console.log(user.fullName); // "John Doe".
```
