# Getting started

## Your first model

### Defining a model

To declare a model, you just need to use the `makeModel` function. This function takes 3 arguments:

- The model `type`, which is used by other services to identify your model or interact with an API.
- The model `schema` (optional), which contains your attributes and relations definitions.
- The model `extension` (optional), which contains additional properties and methods.

```ts title="models/user.js"
import { makeModel, attr } from 'func-model/core';

export default class User extends makeModel('users', {
  firstName: attr<string>(),
  lastName: attr<string>(),
}, {
  get fullName() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  },
}) {
}
```

:::tip
If you never need to import only a model's type (such as in Typescript to avoid circular deps),
you can just export the `makeModel` returned value instead of creating an extended class:

```javascript
export default makeModel('users', /* your model definition... */);
```

[Read the FAQ to understand the why.](/docs/discover#why-classes-are-used-for-models-in-typescript)
:::

### Using models

You can use this model as any Javascript classes (e.g. construct a new instance using `new`). Once
you have an instance, you can use its schema and extensions as classic classes' properties and
methods.

```javascript
const user = new User();
user.firstName = 'John';
user.lastName = 'Doe';
console.log(user.fullName); // "John Doe".
```

## Action factory

Once your models are set up, you will probably want to interact with a data store, such as an API.
For this, you will need an action factory which initialize a preconfigured context
for all your future action.

The following example of action factory is made for a JSON:API implementation.

:::info
Currently, FuncModel only have a JSON:API implementation of actions. However, you can easily
implement your own adapter and/or serialization mechanism to fit your needs.

We are also opened to pull request to propose other implementations.
:::

### Initializing the dependencies

Each action factory may require initial dependencies to correctly work. Each of those dependencies
have a dedicated role and is required for only specific cases. Here is an example with all
the available dependencies initialized.

```javascript title="action.js"
import { makeAction, makeStore, withAdapter, withDeserializer, withSerializer, withStore } from 'func-model/core';
import { makeDeserializer, makeFetchAdapter, makeSerializer } from 'func-model/json-api';

// The store allows the deserializer and other dependencies to known
// which types is associated with which model.
// It is only required when you are deserializing related models not directly
// targeted by an action (e.g. comments related to a post you fetch).
const store = makeStore().register([User, /* Post, Comment */]);

// The serializer allows you to send model instance through your actions.
// It is only required when you are making create/update operations.
const serializer = makeSerializer();

// The deserializer allows you to retrieve model instance through your actions.
// It is only required when you are making read operations.
const deserializer = makeDeserializer();

// The adapter allows you to run actions.
const adapter = makeFetchAdapter({
  // `baseURL` is optional and defaults to "/api".
  baseURL: 'https://example.com/api/v1',
});
```

:::tip
If you do not need a specific dependencies because you won't use the associated features,
you can simply omit its initialization and `use` on the action factory.
:::

### Defining the action factory

Using your dependencies, you can now define your action factory function to preconfigure
the context for each next action.

```javascript title="action.js"
import { makeAction, withAdapter, withDeserializer, withSerializer, withStore } from 'func-model/core';

// The action factory is a simple function returning an action
// with a preconfigured context (avoiding repeating those `use` later).
export default function action() {
  return makeAction()
    .use(withStore(store))
    .use(withSerializer(serializer))
    .use(withDeserializer(deserializer))
    .use(withAdapter(fetchAdapter));
}
```

## Running actions

To run action, you can initialize a new action instance by calling your factory.
With this instance, you can call **context enhancers** through `use` to modify
the action context.
When you are ready, you can `run` the action with a given **context consumer**.

```javascript
import { all, forModel } from 'func-model/core';
import User from './models/user';
import action from './action';

const users = await action()
  .use(forModel(User))
  .run(all());
```

Generally in FuncModel, the context enhancers are doing the majority of work to
customize the action you will run. Context consumers only exists to tell how
you wish to run the action and retrieve the result (raw response,
model instance, etc.).

A great example of this is when finding a model using its ID. You'll not use
a `find` context consumer. Instead, you will need to use a `find` context
enhancer and a `oneOrFail` context consumer. This way, you are able to do
a find query and retrieve a raw result when needed.

```javascript
import { find, oneOrFail, forModel } from 'func-model/core';
import User from './models/user';
import action from './action';

const user = await action()
  .use(forModel(User))
  .use(find('abc-123'))
  .run(oneOrFail());
```

This works the same to send write operations through actions. In the following
example, we are retrieving a raw adapter response instead of model instances.

```javascript
import { create, raw, forModel, fill } from 'func-model/core';
import User from './models/user';
import action from './action';

const user = fill(new User(), {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
});

const response = await action()
  .use(create(user))
  .run(raw());
```

Finally, you may also want to use FuncModel to make non-standard API calls
which are unrelated to models.

```javascript
import { knownData } from 'func-model/core';
import { makePost } from 'func-model/json-api';
import action from './action';

// Make a POST call to "https://example.com/api/v1/services/posts/1/publish"
// Admitting it returns: {"message":"Successfully published post."}
const data = await action()
  .use(makePost('services/posts/1/publish'))
  .run(knownData());

console.log(data.message); // "Successfully published post."
```

:::info
`data` consumer will return the adapter response data (for JSON:API, it is a JSON:API document).

`knownData` will return a generic type data (which defaults to any).
