# Models

:::tip What you'll learn
- Defining basic models with attributes and relationships
- Extending your models with custom properties
- Registering hooks on models
:::

## Model factory

```javascript
import { makeModel } from 'func-client/core';

makeModel('type', { /* definition */ })
```

`makeModel` is the default model factory function. It defines a new model using
2 arguments:

- The string `type` or a configuration object.
- The optional `definition` of the model: an object map containing
attributes/relations definitions and custom properties and methods.

The attributes and relations definition represents the `schema` of the model.

### Extending a model class

`makeModel` will return a model class which can be extended by an ES6 class.

```javascript
export default class Post extends makeModel('Post') {}
```

The returned model class also provides static methods to extend the definition
already provided to `makeModel`.

```javascript
makeModel('Post', { /* definition */ })
  .extends({ /* additional definition */ })
  .extends({ /* another additional definition */ });
```

:::tip
This can be useful when sharing common features across models: creation
timestamps, client side ID generation, etc.

If you wish to learn more about the composition capabilities of models,
you should read the
[**advanced guide about models composition**](/docs/advanced/models-composition).
:::

### Using models classes

Model classes can be used as any classical ES6 class. It can be instantiated,
manipulated, etc. Properties will be defined on each instance from the model
definition.

```javascript
const post = new Post();
post.title = 'Hello World!';
console.log(post.title); // "Hello World!"
console.log(post.isDraft); // true
console.log(post.exists); // false
```

:::info
Most model's interaction (fetching, updating, etc.) are done through actions,
so you may [**read the actions guide**](/docs/essentials/actions) to learn more
about those.
:::

:::info
FuncClient also propose multiple utilities to work with models:
[**read the models utilities API guide**](/docs/api/models-utilities).
:::

## Definition

:::caution
You must not use `id`, `lid`, `type` or `exists` as key of any
attributes/relations/properties as those keys are internally used by FuncClient
or may be used by some dependencies (JSON:API adapter for example).
:::

### Attributes

`attr` is an attribute definition factory function to use when you wish to
define your model's attributes. It may take 0 to 2 arguments, depending on
what you want to do.

```ts
import { attr, toDate } from 'func-client/core';

attr<string>(); // Without config.
attr(toDate()); // With a transformer.
attr({ default: '', transformer: toDate() }); // With config.
attr(toDate(), { readonly: true }); // With a transformer and config.
attr({ default: () => [] }); // With a factory default (required for objects props).
```

:::caution
Note that FuncClient consider your attributes as non-nullable values by default.
When one of your model contains nullable attributes, you may want to pass a type
to the factory (`attr<string | null>()`) or set a default attribute value.
:::

#### Configuration

You may customize your attribute with the following config:

| Key           | Type           | Defaults    | Description                                                                           |
|---------------|----------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `transformer` | `Transform<T>` | `undefined` | The transformer for the prop's value when interacting with your backend.              |
| `default`     | `T`            | `undefined` | The default value for the prop when initializing a model instance.                    |
| `readonly`    | `boolean`      | `false`     | The value won't be serialized when sending the data to your backend.                  |
| `alias`       | `string`       | `undefined` | The key to (de)serialize the prop's value from/in when interacting with your backend. |

#### Transform

You can use a transform to convert an attribute value when (de)serializing from/to your backend.
There are two types or transformer within FuncClient:

- `FunctionTransform`: a function to call to transform the value whether we are serializing or deserializing it.
- `ObjectTransform`: an object with two methods: `serialize` and `deserialize`.

FuncClient propose you 4 transformers out of the box:
[`toDate`](/docs/api/func-client/modules/core#todate),
[`toNumber`](/docs/api/func-client/modules/core#tonumber),
[`toBoolean`](/docs/api/func-client/modules/core#toboolean) and
[`toString`](/docs/api/func-client/modules/core#tostring).

:::tip
You may need other transformers in your implementation, for example when you
are using a library to manage dates (momentjs, dayjs, etc.). You may read the
[**advanced guide on transformers**](/docs/advanced/custom-transformers)
to learn more about those.
:::

### Relations

`hasMany` and `hasOne` are relation definition factory function to use when
you wish to define your model's relations. As suggested by their names,
`hasMany` represents a relation to a list of model and `hasOne` represents a
relation to a single model.
It may take 0 to 1 argument, depending on what you want to do.

```ts
// file: models/user.ts noEmit
import { makeModel } from 'func-client/core';
export default class User extends makeModel('users') {}

// file: models/comment.ts noEmit
import { makeModel } from 'func-client/core';
export default class Comment extends makeModel('comments') {}

// file: models/example.ts
import { hasOne, hasMany } from 'func-client/core';
import type User from './user';
import type Comment from './comment';

hasOne<User>(); // Without config.
hasOne<User>({ readonly: true }); // With config.

hasMany<Comment>(); // Without config.
hasMany<Comment>({ readonly: true }); // With config.
```

:::tip
When using TypeScript, you should define the type of the relation to get a
fully strongly typed model. We suggest you to use `import type` to avoid
creating circular dependencies when having circular model relations.
:::

:::caution
Note that FuncClient consider your relations as non-nullable values by default.
When one of your model contains nullable relations, you may want to pass a type
to the factory (`hasOne<User | null>()`) or set a default relation value.

Also consider that non-loaded relations will have a value of `undefined`.
:::

#### Configuration

You may customize your relation with the following config:

| Key           | Type           | Defaults    | Description                                                                           |
|---------------|----------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `default`     | `T`            | `undefined` | The default value for the prop when initializing a model instance.                    |
| `readonly`    | `boolean`      | `false`     | The value won't be serialized when sending the data to your backend.                  |
| `alias`       | `string`       | `undefined` | The key to (de)serialize the prop's value from/in when interacting with your backend. |

### Custom properties

In addition to attributes and relations, you may want to implement additional
properties to your model. It will be useful when you need computed values
(getters) or specific instance methods.

This can be done using the definition or an extending class:

```javascript
// Directly in the definition.
export default makeModel('users', {
  firstName: attr(),
  lastName: attr(),
  get fullName() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`
  }
});

// Inside an extending class.
export default class User extends makeModel('users', {
  firstName: attr(),
  lastName: attr(),
}) {
  get fullName() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`
  }
}
```

## Hooks

You may hook on multiple events which occurs on model instance using the hook
registration functions:

- `onRetrieved`: instance was deserialized from a backend response.
- `onCreating`: action to create instance will run soon.
- `onCreated`: action to create instance was ran successfully.
- `onUpdating`: action to update instance will run soon.
- `onUpdated`: action to update instance was ran successfully.
- `onSaving`: action to save (create or update) instance will run soon (always ran after `onCreating` and `onUpdating`).
- `onSaved`: action to save (create or update) instance was ran successfully (always ran after `onCreated` and `onUpdated`).
- `onDestroying`: action to destroy instance will run soon.
- `onDestroyed`: action to destroy instance was ran successfully.

To register a hook callback, you must pass a model class and a callback
function to the registration function. It will return a function which
you may call to unregister the hook. All model hook callback will have
the concerned model instance as the only provided argument.

```javascript
import { onSaving } from 'func-client/core';

const unregisterThisHook = onSaving(User, async (user) => {
  // TODO Do something (a)sync with user instance before saving.
});
```

:::info
As you may notice above, hooks callback may be async and will be ran
sequentially (one by one, not parallelized).
:::

You can disable hook execution on a given model by using the `withoutHooks`
function.

```javascript
import { withoutHooks } from 'func-client/core';

const resultOfCallback = await withoutHooks(User, async () => {
  // TODO Do something (a)sync and return it.
});
```
