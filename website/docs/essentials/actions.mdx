# Actions

:::tip What you'll learn
- Building actions
- Registering hooks on actions
- Available context enhancers
- Available context runners
:::

:::caution Requirements
Before reading this guide, you should have a working action factory. You can
read the [**getting started guide**](/docs/getting-started#your-first-actions)
to quickly create your own action factory.
:::

## Enhancing and running

As stated in the [getting started guide](/docs/getting-started#running-actions), actions are
instantiated through your action factory, evolved with context enhancers and
ran by context runners.

```javascript
const posts = await action()
  .use(model(Post))
  .use(include('comments'))
  .run(all());
```

In the example above:

- `action()` is your action factory
- `model(Post)` and `include('comments')` are context enhancers which we `use`
- `all()` is a context runner which we `run`

When you instantiate a new action, you can `use` multiple context enhancers.
Those enhancers will be queued until the `run` call.

An enhancer take the action with a given context and enhancer its context. It
might use other enhancers. An enhancer may return an instance of an action
or void.

A runner take the action with its context and use it to return a result. It
might use other enhancers and runners. A runner may return any result (
including void, throwing error, etc.).

## Hooks

You may hook on multiple events which occurs on action instance using the hook
registration function:

- `onPreparing`: before context computation through enhancers dequeueing.
- `onRunning`: after context computation, before context runner execution.
- `onSuccess`: after context runner successful execution (no error thrown).
- `onError`: after context runner failed execution (error thrown).
- `onFinally`: after context runner successful or failed execution.

To register a hook callback, you must use the registration enhancer on your
building action.

```javascript
import { onPreparing, onRunning, onSuccess, onError, onFinally } from 'func-client/core';

action().use(onPreparing(() => /* ... */));
action().use(onRunning(({ context }) => /* ... */));
action().use(onSuccess(({ context, result }) => /* ... */));
action().use(onError(({ context, error }) => /* ... */));
action().use(onFinally(({ context }) => /* ... */));
```

:::tip
Hooks callback may be async and will be ran sequentially
(one by one, not parallelized).
:::

You can disable hook execution on a given action instance by using the
`withoutHooks` function.

```javascript
import { withoutHooks } from 'func-client/core';

const users = await withoutHooks(action(), async (a) => {
  return await a.use(model(User)).run(all());
});
```

:::info
FuncClient will also register hooks when using some enhancers. Those will
provide some library features ([models hooks](/docs/essentials/models#hooks),
etc.).
:::

## Note on enhancers and runners

Any context enhancers or runners in this guide may:

- <Chip>depend</Chip> on a minimal package version
- <Chip color="primary">only</Chip> be available in a given use case
(JSON:API, etc.)
- <Chip color="success">provide</Chip> a given context to next enhancers
or runners
- <Chip color="danger">require</Chip> a given context from previous enhancers
or runners

Most runners will execute an action through the adapter.

The examples will omit imports of your action factories or models to
provide shorter examples.

## Available enhancers

<Chip color="primary">Work in progress</Chip>

### `context`

Merge the given context into the action's current context.
**The context is not deeply merged.**

This is the most basic context enhancer. It is used by a lot of FuncClient
enhancers.

#### Example

```javascript
import { context } from 'func-client/core';

action().use(context({ method: 'GET', path: 'hello-world' }));
```

#### Arguments

- [`{Partial<ActionContext>}`](/docs/api/types#actioncontext) `contextToMerge`
the context to merge into the action's current context

### `model`

<FunctionInfo provides="Model" />

Target the given model.
Register the given model and its definition onto the action's current context.

#### Example

```javascript
import { model } from 'func-client/core';

action().use(model(Post));
```

#### Arguments

- [`{Model<D, I>}`](/docs/api/types#modeld-i) `modelToUse` the model class to use

### `include`

<FunctionInfo requires="Model" />

Eager load the given relations for the current model definition. It accepts
deep relations through dot notation. The new relations will be merged with the
previous ones.

#### Example

```javascript
import { include } from 'func-client/core';

action().use(include(['author', 'comments', 'comments.reactions']));
```

#### Arguments

- [`{Arrayable<ModelRelationDotKey<M>>}`](/docs/api/types#modelrelationdotkeym)
`relations` a relation or a set of relation to eager load

### `fields`

<FunctionInfo
  only="JSON:API"
  requires="Model"
/>

Select the given
[JSON:API fieldsets](https://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-sparse-fieldsets)
for the current context's model. The new fieldsets will be merged with the
previous ones.

#### Example

```javascript
import { fields } from 'func-client/json-api';

action().use(fields(['title', 'description']));
```

#### Arguments

- [`{Arrayable<ModelKey<M>>}`](/docs/api/types#modelkeym) `fieldset` a
field or a set of field to select for the current context's model

### `fieldsFor`

<FunctionInfo only="JSON:API" />

Select the given
[JSON:API fieldsets](https://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-sparse-fieldsets)
for the given model. The new fieldsets will be merged with the
previous ones.

#### Example

```javascript
import { fieldsFor } from 'func-client/json-api';

action().use(fieldsFor(Post, ['title', 'description']));
```

#### Arguments

- [`{ModelClass<D>}`](/docs/api/types#modelclassd) `model` the model
to select the fieldsets for
- [`{Arrayable<ModelKey<M>>}`](/docs/api/types#modelkeym) `fieldset` a
field or a set of field to select for the given model

### `sortBy`

<FunctionInfo only="JSON:API" />

[Sort the JSON:API resource](https://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-sorting)
by the given key and direction. The new sort will be merged with the
previous ones. **Sorts priority are kept**.

#### Example

```javascript
import { sortBy } from 'func-client/json-api';

action().use(sortBy('createdAt'));
```

#### Arguments

- `{string}` `key` the key for the sort
- `{'asc' | 'desc' = 'asc'}` `direction` the direction for the sort

### `sortByDesc`

<FunctionInfo only="JSON:API" />

Shortcut for the [`sortBy` function](#sortby) with a `desc` direction.

#### Example

```javascript
import { sortByDesc } from 'func-client/json-api';

action().use(sortByDesc('createdAt'));
```

#### Arguments

- `{string}` `key` the key for the sort

## Available runners

<Chip color="primary">Work in progress</Chip>

### `none`

<FunctionInfo requires="Adapter" />

Run the action and ignore the content of the result.
Adapter errors are not caught and so may be thrown.

#### Example

```javascript
import { none } from 'func-client/core';

await action().run(none());
```

#### Returns

`{Promise<void>}`

### `all`

<FunctionInfo requires="Adapter, Deserializer, Model" />

Run the action and deserialize an array of model's instance.

#### Example

```javascript
import { all } from 'func-client/core';

const posts = await action().run(all());
```

#### Returns

`{Promise<I[]>}` where `I` is an instance of the targeted model.
