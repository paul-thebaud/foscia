# Actions

:::caution Requirements
Before reading this guide, you should have a working action factory. You can
read the [**getting started guide**](/docs/getting-started#your-first-actions)
to quickly create your own action factory.
:::

:::tip What you'll learn

- Enhancing actions
- Running actions
- Registering hooks on actions

:::

## Instantiation

As stated in the [getting started guide](/docs/getting-started#running-actions),
actions are instantiated through your action factory. In this guide, we'll
admit you have a setup action factory.

## Enhancements

An action instance may receive none to many enhancements, which will provide
an appropriate context to run a request through data source.

Each enhancer can be applied using the `use` action method.
Note that those enhancers are not instantly applied to the action
context, but during the action run step (or context computation).

```javascript
action()
  // Enhance the action.
  .use(model(Post))
  .use(include('comments'));
```

## Run

An action instance can be run using the `run` method. The runner may use
enhancers or runners internally.

When an action run, it does 3 things:

- Dequeue all enhancers since the action instantiation and build context
- Execute the runner and each of its internal enhancers/runners (this may update
  the context)
- Return the runner's result (might be any value, including void or an error
  throwing)

Internally, action running will also trigger [actions hooks](#hooks).

```javascript
action()
  .use(model(Post))
  .use(include('comments'))
  // Run the action.
  .run(all());
```

## Conditionals

Sometimes, you may need to conditionally apply an enhancer or run an action.
As an example, you may want to sort results differently based on the user's
defined sort's direction. This can be done easily using the `when` helper:

```javascript
import { when } from 'func-client/core';
import { sortByDesc } from 'func-client/jsonapi';

action()
  .use(model(Post))
  .use(when(
    displayLatestFirst,
    sortByDesc('createdAt'),
  ));
```

`when` returns a new enhancer or runner depending on the given value's
*truthiness*. It will execute the first enhancer/runner only if its value is
*truthy*. You may pass the value as a factory function returning the value.
You may also pass a second enhancer/runner which will only execute if the value
is *falsy*.
Each callback arguments will receive the action as their first argument and the
value as their second argument. Each callback may also be async, as any
enhancers and runners.

Here are further examples:

```javascript
import { changed, create, oneOrFail, when } from 'func-client/core';

const post = fill(new Post(), userInputData);

action()
  .use(create(post))
  .use(when(
    () => /* compute a special value */,
    (a, specialTruthyValue) => /* do something */,
    (a, specialFalsyValue) => /* do something */,
  ))
  .run(when(
    changed(post),
    oneOrFail(),
    () => post,
  ));
```

## Hooks

You may hook on multiple events which occurs on action instance using the hook
registration function:

- `onPreparing`: before context computation through enhancers dequeueing.
- `onRunning`: after context computation, before context runner execution.
- `onSuccess`: after context runner successful execution (no error thrown).
- `onError`: after context runner failed execution (error thrown).
- `onFinally`: after context runner successful or failed execution.

To register a hook callback, you must use the registration enhancer on your
building action.

```javascript
import {
  onPreparing,
  onRunning,
  onSuccess,
  onError,
  onFinally
} from 'func-client/core';

action().use(onPreparing(() => /* ... */));
action().use(onRunning(({ context }) => /* ... */));
action().use(onSuccess(({ context, result }) => /* ... */));
action().use(onError(({ context, error }) => /* ... */));
action().use(onFinally(({ context }) => /* ... */));
```

:::info
Hooks callback may be async and will be ran sequentially
(one by one, not parallelized).
:::

You can disable hook execution on a given action instance by using the
`withoutHooks` function.

```javascript
import { withoutHooks } from 'func-client/core';

const users = await withoutHooks(action(), async (a) => {
  return await a.use(model(User)).run(all());
});
```

:::caution
FuncClient may also register hooks internally when using some enhancers.
Those provide some library features
([**models hooks**](/docs/essentials/models#hooks), etc.).
Be careful running actions without hooks, as those hooks will also be disable.
