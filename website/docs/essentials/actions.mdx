# Actions

:::tip What you'll learn
- Enhancing actions
- Running actions
- Registering hooks on actions
:::

:::caution Requirements
Before reading this guide, you should have a working action factory. You can
read the [**getting started guide**](/docs/getting-started#your-first-actions)
to quickly create your own action factory.
:::

## Instantiation

As stated in the [getting started guide](/docs/getting-started#running-actions),
actions are instantiated through your action factory.

## Enhancements

An action instance may receive none to many enhancements, which will provide
an appropriate context to run a request through data source.

Each enhancer can be applied using the `use` action method.

```javascript
action()
  // Enhance the action.
  .use(model(Post))
  .use(include('comments'));
```

:::info
All enhancers are listed in the
[**actions' available enhancers API guide**](/docs/api/actions-enhancers).
:::

:::caution
Please note that context enhancer are not instantly applied to the action
context, but during the action run step.
:::

## Run

An action instance can be run using the `run` method. The runner may use
enhancers or runners internally.

When an action run, it does 3 things:

- Dequeue all enhancers since the action instantiation and build context
- Execute the runner and each of its internal enhancers/runners (this may update the context)
- Return the runner's result (might be any value, including void or an error throwing)

Internally, action running will also trigger [actions hooks](#hooks).

```javascript
action()
  .use(model(Post))
  .use(include('comments'))
  // Run the action.
  .run(all());
```

:::info
All runners are listed in the
[**actions' available runners API guide**](/docs/api/actions-runners).
:::

## Hooks

You may hook on multiple events which occurs on action instance using the hook
registration function:

- `onPreparing`: before context computation through enhancers dequeueing.
- `onRunning`: after context computation, before context runner execution.
- `onSuccess`: after context runner successful execution (no error thrown).
- `onError`: after context runner failed execution (error thrown).
- `onFinally`: after context runner successful or failed execution.

To register a hook callback, you must use the registration enhancer on your
building action.

```javascript
import { onPreparing, onRunning, onSuccess, onError, onFinally } from 'func-client/core';

action().use(onPreparing(() => /* ... */));
action().use(onRunning(({ context }) => /* ... */));
action().use(onSuccess(({ context, result }) => /* ... */));
action().use(onError(({ context, error }) => /* ... */));
action().use(onFinally(({ context }) => /* ... */));
```

:::tip
Hooks callback may be async and will be ran sequentially
(one by one, not parallelized).
:::

You can disable hook execution on a given action instance by using the
`withoutHooks` function.

```javascript
import { withoutHooks } from 'func-client/core';

const users = await withoutHooks(action(), async (a) => {
  return await a.use(model(User)).run(all());
});
```

:::caution
FuncClient may also register hooks internally when using some enhancers.
Those provide some library features ([**models hooks**](/docs/essentials/models#hooks), etc.).
Be careful running actions without hooks, as those hooks will also be disable.
