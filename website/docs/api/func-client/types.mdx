# Internal types

:::tip
FuncClient uses some utilities types which are not exported to avoid
polluting your code or conflicting with your own utilities types.
You may copy those types as you want and use them in your project.
:::

## Constructor

```typescript
type Constructor<T> = new (...args: any[]) => T;
```

## Dictionary

```typescript
type Dictionary<T = unknown> = { [K: string]: T };
```

## Arrayable

```typescript
type Arrayable<T> = T | T[];
```

## Awaitable

```typescript
type Awaitable<T> = T | Promise<T>;
```
