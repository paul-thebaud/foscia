## What is FuncClient?

**FuncClient** is a simple functional programming oriented API client. It is
framework-agnostic and can integrate with any Web app using JavaScript or
TypeScript, and with any data source.

- Modular, highly extensible and fully tree shakable thanks to functional
programming.
[See the benefits](/docs/faq#why-are-we-not-using-big-model-and-builder-classes)
- Ready to use functions to integrate with any [JSON:API](https://jsonapi.org/)
- Strongly typed everywhere, with generics typings on models, actions, etc.
- Dependency free (JSON:API adapter is based
on [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API))
- (coming soon) Fully linted, tested and documented

## What to do now?
