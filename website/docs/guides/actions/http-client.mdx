# HTTP client

:::tip What you'll learn

-   Configuring your action factory to only make HTTP request
-   Using Foscia as an HTTP client

:::

## Creating the action factory

**If you are using a REST or JSON:API blueprints, you can already use your
action as an HTTP client.**

You can use Foscia as a simple HTTP client (just like Axios).
For this, you can configure an HTTP client action factory.


```javascript title="action.js"
import { makeHttpClient } from 'foscia/blueprints';

const { action } = makeHttpClient({
    baseURL: 'https://example.com',
});

export default action;
```

## Using the HTTP client features

Once your action factory is ready, sending HTTP request is pretty easy:

```javascript
import { makeGet, makePost } from 'foscia/http';
import { action } from './action';

// GET https://example.com/
const response = await action()
    .use(makeGet('/'))
    .run(raw());

// GET https://example.com/api/posts (and get JSON payload)
const data = await action()
    .use(makePost('/api/posts', {
      data: { title: 'Hello World!' },
    }))
    .run(raw((response) => response.json()));
```
